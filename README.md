# Chainer Models

This repository contains a number of models implemented in [Chainer](https://github.com/chainer/chainer).

# Contributing guidelines
If you have created a model, please send us a pull request. 
For those just getting started with pull requests, GitHub has a [howto](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

We have a list of candidate papers to implement: https://github.com/chainer/models/projects/1
